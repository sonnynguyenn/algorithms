# Dot product
**Dot product** is the product of two vector that result in the *scalar* that is related to one of them. The *scalar* when used to scale (or multiply) one of the vector, it has result is a new vector that is perpendicular to the other vector at the base of that vector. For example, we take the dot product between **a** and **b** vector which results in *c*, a scalar number. Scaling **a** with *c* will result in a vector *A*, which is concident to a, the result of *b* - *A* will be a vector that is perpendicular to *a* and *A*, if we add that to *a* vector, we will get *B*. The result is the same as doing this with vector *b* as being scaled.<br>

## Formula
For vector of **any dimension**, the formula will be `scalar = a.x*b.x + a.y*b.y + a.z*b.z + ...`
