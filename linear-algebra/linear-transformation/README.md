# Linear transformation
*Linear transformation* is the term used for the transforming of axis *X*, *Y* are also basis vectors, which cause the change in values under 'the origin perspective'. <br>
Remember the concept default `Y = [ 0 1 ]` and default `X = [ 1 0 ]`? Assume that `V = [ 0.5 0.5 ]`, if we apply the
