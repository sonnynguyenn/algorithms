# Linear transformation
*Linear transformation* is the term used for the transforming of axis *X*, *Y* are also basis vectors, which cause the change in values under 'the origin perspective'. <br>
Remember the concept default `Y = [ 0 1 ]` and default `X = [ 1 0 ]`; A vector's elements can represent a point that moves along the axes; And the multiplication of a number to a vector. Assume that `V = [ 0.5 0.5 ]`, we apply the things above so we can say that, (*v is the transformed form of V; X and Y are the basis*) `v = V.x * X + V.y * Y` or `v = [ 1*0.5 0*0.5 ] + [ 0*0.5 1*0.5 ] = [ 0.5 0 ] + [ 0 0.5 ] = [ 0+0.5 0+0.5] = [0.5 0.5]`. We can see that the result is equal to the original *V* as the `[1 0]` and `[0 1]` is the default value of vector *X* and *Y* respectively. Feel free to play around with the basis vector and the *V* transformation. You can use [*GeoGebra*](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator).
