# Vector in linear algebra
In linear algebra, a vector can store information about a point (position) or a direction. Overall, whatever information is stored inside a vector, the number always could be understood as an offset from the origin. <br>
Let's say, we are working in 2D of linear algebra in default, we have two axes, `Y = [ 0 1 ]`  and `X = [ 1 0 ]`.

And if we add a point `B = [0.5 0.5]` which says point B at x 0.5 and y 0.5<br>

## Vector addition
In [Essential of vector](../../vital-concepts/vector/README.md), adding vectors results in a new vector in which each element is the sum of the corresponding element of participating vectors. Vectors in linear algebra behave the same way as well. Moreover, the operation when visualized in graphs shows that the resultant vector is the offset from v<sub>1</sub> as v<sub>2</sub> offset from the origin.<br>
+ For example we take `v = [ 0.5 0.5 ]` + `u = [ 0.2 0.1 ]`, as calculation, the result vector is `r = [ 0.7 0.6]`<br>
