# Vector in linear algebra
In linear algebra, a vector can store information about a point (position) or a direction. Overall, whatever information is stored inside a vector, the number always could be understood as an offset from the origin. <br>
Let's say, we are working in 2D of linear algebra in default, we have two axes, `Y = [ 0 1 ]`  and `X = [ 1 0 ]`.

And if we add a point `B = [0.5 0.5]` which says point B at x 0.5 and y 0.5
