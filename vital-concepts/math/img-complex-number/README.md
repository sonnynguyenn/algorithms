# Imagninery unit and complex number
## Imaginery unit
**i** is the imaginery unit where $\ i^2 = -1\$.
With any exponent larger than 2, we can do so: <br>
$\ i^3 = i^2i = -1i = -i\$ <br>
$\ i^4 = i^2i^2 = (-1)(-1) = 1\$ <br>
$\ i^5 = i^2i^2i = (-1)(-1)i = 1i = i\$ <br>
and so on...<br><br>
This imaginary unit can also be scaled like $\ 4i, 2i, πi,-0.4i, xi, ...\$ to be an imaginary number.
## Complex number
**Complex number** is a number that is created by adding a real number ($\ 2,3,π,6,0.3,{3 \over 4}, ...\$) with an imaginary number( $\ 4i, 2i, πi,-0.4i, xi, ...\$)
+ Example:
$\ 1 + 1i \$,
$\ i \$,
$\ 1 \$,
$\ 2 + {3 \over 5}i \$,
...
### Complex plane
Normally, in real numbers, we can represent a number by placing them on an axis.<br>

In complex numbers, it has another axis for the imaginary number ($\ i\$) which is perpendicular to the real number axis and intersects at $\ 0\$ and $\ 0i\$. The $\ i\$ axis can be perceived as the scaling of the $\ i\$.<br>
