# Quadratic equation
*Quadratic equation* are equation $\ ax^2 + bx = c\$ or $\ ax^2 + bx + c = 0\$ where *a*, *b*, *c* are constants.
<br>
# Solving
Divide every element with constant *a* $\ x^2 + {b \over a}x = {c \over a}\$ .The current equation can be visualized in the image below. <br/>![dw](https://github.com/sonnynguyenn/algorithms/blob/main/vital-concepts/math/quadratic-equation/images/quadratic-equation-image-1.png) <br/>
Or the $\{b \over a}\$ can be divide to two halves $\{b \over 2a}\$
